# USHousingMarketAnalysis

## Project Summary

### Objective
Find publicly available data for key factors that influence US home prices nationally. Then, build a data science model that explains how these factors impacted home prices over the last 20 years.
Use the S&P Case-Schiller Home Price Index as a proxy for home prices.

### Features for Analysis
1. **CSUSHPISA:** Measures changes in residential property prices in the US.
2. **EVACANTUSQ176N:** Estimates the number of vacant housing units in the US.
3. **GDP:** Represents the total value of goods and services produced in the US.
4. **INTDSRUSM193N:** Reflects interest rates or discount rates in the US.
5. **MSACSR:** Measures the monthly supply of new houses in the US.
6. **PERMIT:** Tracks the number of new housing units authorized by permits.
7. **UMCSENT:** Reflects consumer sentiment about the economy.

### Project Scope
- Analyze the correlation between these factors and CSUSHPISA.
- Develop a predictive model using machine learning to forecast CSUSHPISA based on these factors.
- Evaluate the model's accuracy and predictive power.
- Identify key factors contributing most significantly to changes in the home price index.

### Next Steps
1. **Data Collection and Preparation:**
   - Gather historical data for the specified features.
   - Clean and preprocess the data for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualize relationships between features and CSUSHPISA.
   - Identify correlations and patterns.
3. **Model Development:**
   - Build predictive models using regression or machine learning algorithms.
   - Train and validate the models.
4. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.
   - Fine-tune models for better accuracy.
5. **Insights and Reporting:**
   - Interpret model results to understand the impact of each feature on CSUSHPISA.
   - Generate insights and recommendations based on the analysis.

### Expected Outcome
- A robust predictive model that effectively estimates changes in the S&P/Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index based on economic and housing-related factors.
